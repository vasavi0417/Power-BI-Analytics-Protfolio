# Client Scorecard  Dashboard

Client Scorecard Report is a valuable tool for evaluating the financial performance and recovery efforts related to each client. This report tracks key metrics such as revenue generated from collections, payment history, Inventory and placements count. It also provides insights into outstanding payments and inventory of accounts under collection, offering a clear view of client placements and their recovery status. By consolidating data on payments received, inventory of accounts, and recovery trends, the scorecard helps the agency prioritize efforts, improve collections strategies, and enhance client relationships.

Client Scorecard Dashboard Development: I developed a comprehensive Client Scorecard Dashboard that summarizes key metrics, including client revenue, payments, recoveries, placements, and inventory. This dashboard provides detailed insights at various levels such as state, client, department, and account type, allowing for granular analysis of performance across these categories.

Key features I implemented include:

Data Visualization: Presented data using visuals, tables, cards, and drill-through capabilities, enabling users to easily navigate through detailed reports and gain a deep understanding of the data.
Bookmarks: Integrated bookmarks for seamless and efficient navigation, allowing users to switch between different views and reports without losing context.
This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for tracking financial performance and client activity, enhancing decision-making by offering an intuitive and detailed representation of key business metrics.

Result of Client Scorecard Implementation: The Client Scorecard has proven to be an invaluable tool for director-level stakeholders, providing a clear understanding of the overall business performance as well as detailed insights at the department level. By offering a comprehensive view of metrics such as payments, recoveries, and client activity, the dashboard has enabled more informed and strategic decision-making.

As a result of the insights gained through the scorecard, our company has improved its performance, achieving a 25% increase in payments collected from debtors compared to last year.
